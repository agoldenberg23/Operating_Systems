This is a java file and can be ran with the following commands:
javac Scheduler.java
java Scheduler <Processes File Name>

Or for verbose output:
java Scheduler --verbose <Processes File Name>

Additionally, this supports further debugging output if wanted
(not part of the assignment)
java Scheduler --Hverbose <Processes File Name>

This requires the common java util, math and io libraries.
A random number file, Random_Numbers, is needed and is supplied 
for use. Place the random number file in the same relative path 
as the program file.
